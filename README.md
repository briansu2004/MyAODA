## My AODA Projects

### Project 3

<!-- For Sunlife -->

In alignment with AODA compliance and accessibility best practices, I utilized a variety of tools to enhance the web application's accessibility. This included conducting comprehensive accessibility audits using JAWS screen reader to ensure compatibility for users with visual impairments, and leveraging the axe Chrome extension and Siteimprove extension to identify and resolve web accessibility issues related to WCAG 2.1 standards. By incorporating these tools, I ensured that the application provided an inclusive user experience, meeting the necessary accessibility standards for diverse user groups.

### Project 2
<!-- For MOH -->

In the migration of monolith applications to web-based microservices, I prioritized accessibility compliance by utilizing tools such as Color Contrast Checkers and AXE DevTools. These tools helped me assess and improve the accessibility of the user interface by ensuring that color combinations met contrast requirements, making content more readable for individuals with visual impairments. Additionally, AXE DevTools allowed for thorough testing of web components against WCAG 2.1 standards, ensuring that all features were navigable and usable via assistive technologies. By incorporating these accessibility checks into the development process, I was able to enhance the overall user experience and ensure compliance with AODA standards, fostering an inclusive application for all users.

### Project 1

<!-- For EDU -->

To ensure that the license management web application was fully compliant with AODA and WCAG 2.1 guidelines, I employed accessibility tools such as Compliance Sheriff and the WAVE toolbar. These tools were instrumental in identifying accessibility gaps, including issues with color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility. By integrating these tools into the development lifecycle, I was able to address potential barriers early on, ensuring that the application adhered to accessibility standards and provided an inclusive experience for all users, including those with disabilities.

## What is AODA?

The **AODA** stands for the **Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act**. It is a law in Ontario, Canada, aimed at making the province more accessible for people with disabilities. The goal of the AODA is to remove and prevent barriers for individuals with disabilities in key areas of daily living by 2025.

Under the AODA, organizations must follow standards to improve accessibility in several areas:

1. **Customer Service**: Ensuring services are accessible to people with disabilities.
2. **Information and Communication**: Making information, like websites and digital content, accessible.
3. **Employment**: Implementing accessible hiring practices and workplace accommodations.
4. **Transportation**: Ensuring public transportation is accessible.
5. **Design of Public Spaces**: Ensuring physical spaces, like buildings and outdoor spaces, are accessible.

Organizations in Ontario are required to comply with the AODA and report on their progress toward accessibility goals. The act is part of broader efforts to create an inclusive environment for all Ontarians.

## AODA tools?

**AODA tools** are resources, software, and services that help organizations comply with the **Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)**. These tools are designed to help remove barriers for people with disabilities and ensure that information, services, and environments are accessible. The tools often focus on areas like web accessibility, digital content, and physical spaces. Here are some common types of AODA tools:

### 1. **Web Accessibility Tools**

These tools help ensure that websites and digital content meet accessibility standards such as **WCAG 2.0/2.1** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), which are required under the AODA for web and digital content. Examples include:

- **WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)**: Helps evaluate web content for accessibility issues.
- **Axe Accessibility Tool**: A browser extension that checks websites for compliance with accessibility standards.
- **Siteimprove**: A platform that scans websites for accessibility issues, broken links, and SEO optimizations.
- **Deque Systems (Axe DevTools)**: Offers accessibility testing solutions integrated with web development environments.

### 2. **Screen Reader Testing Tools**

Screen readers are used by people with visual impairments to navigate websites. Developers can use these tools to test their websites for screen reader compatibility:

- **JAWS (Job Access With Speech)**: One of the most popular screen readers for Windows.
- **NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access)**: A free screen reader for Windows.
- **VoiceOver**: A built-in screen reader for macOS and iOS devices.

### 3. **Color Contrast Checkers**

These tools help ensure that text and background color combinations are accessible to individuals with visual impairments:

- **Contrast Ratio**: A simple web-based tool that checks the contrast ratio between text and background colors.
- **Accessible Colors**: Allows designers to select accessible color combinations for web content.

### 4. **Keyboard Accessibility Tools**

These tools help ensure that websites and applications can be fully navigated using only a keyboard, which is important for users with mobility impairments:

- **Keyboard Accessibility Tester**: A tool to test whether all interactive elements on a page can be accessed via keyboard.
  
### 5. **PDF Accessibility Tools**

For making PDFs accessible, ensuring documents are tagged properly and can be navigated by screen readers:

- **Adobe Acrobat Pro**: Includes tools for adding tags, alt text for images, and ensuring proper heading structure for PDFs.
- **CommonLook**: A suite of tools for ensuring that PDFs meet AODA and WCAG compliance.

### 6. **Captioning and Transcription Tools**

Tools that provide captions for videos and transcriptions for audio content, which are essential for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing:

- **Rev**: A service for creating captions and transcriptions.
- **Otter.ai**: AI-powered transcription service that can automatically generate captions.

### 7. **Accessible Design Tools**

These tools assist in designing user interfaces that are accessible from the start:

- **Figma Accessibility Plugin**: Helps designers check the accessibility of their UI designs for issues such as color contrast and font size.
- **Stark**: A plugin for design tools like Sketch and Figma that checks for contrast, color blindness simulations, and provides other accessibility features.

### 8. **Physical Accessibility Tools**

For organizations ensuring that physical spaces meet AODA standards, there are tools that assess accessibility in terms of building entrances, signage, and other physical features:

- **Accessibility Audits**: Services and tools that provide a full assessment of the physical accessibility of buildings and spaces, often covering features like ramps, elevators, and tactile signage.

### 9. **Employee Training Tools**

AODA compliance also includes employee awareness and training on accessibility:

- **AODA Online Training**: Many organizations offer AODA compliance training for employees, covering customer service, information, and employment standards.
- **AccessForward**: A free online training resource designed to help Ontario organizations meet AODA training requirements.
